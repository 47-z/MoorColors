# MoorColors
More color cosmetics for the game WEBFISHING.

Requires [Lure](https://github.com/Sulayre/WebfishingLure) and [GDWeave](https://github.com/NotNite/GDWeave/tree/main)
<br>
Modded fur colors can not be seen by players that don't have the mod installed. Your character will appear as a default white cat in these cases.
